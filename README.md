# Ancient Architecture distill LLM
 ## SFï¼šAAdLLM
**Project Introduction**

AAdLLM is an open-source project built upon a large language model (DeepSeek R1 7B version), dedicated to the protection of historical buildings. By integrating defect analysis and process archive generation technologies, this project aims to support scientific research and conservation efforts for historical architecture. Our mission is to harness advanced multimodal data processing and natural language generation capabilities to preserve and protect every historical building.
##
## Features
The project offers two core functionalities, each with three sub-features, outlined below:
   
**1. Cause Analysis Method Based on Multimodal Data**

-   Multi-Structure Data Interaction and Fusion Method: Combines diverse structured and unstructured data to produce comprehensive defect analyses for historical buildings.
    
-   Digitalized Cause Display Method: Converts complex defect causes into intuitive digital visualizations, facilitating research and practical application.
    
-   Natural Language Cause Analysis Method with Localized Expert Experience: Integrates local expert knowledge with natural language processing to deliver precise and practical defect cause analyses.
    

**2. Process Archive Generation Method Based on DeepSeek R1 Model**

-   Process Archive Format Learning: Automatically learns and generates process archives in industry-standard formats, enhancing efficiency.
    
-   Time-Varying Information and Fixed Mapping Method: Ensures accurate and consistent mapping between time-varying and fixed information in archives.
    
-   Historical Building Damage Evolution Technology: Employs model-based inference to predict the damage evolution of historical buildings, offering valuable insights for conservation planning.
